Let me first look at the reference screenshots and any existing blocks for patterns.

Let me check for existing block examples and the `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes` function.

Now I have a good understanding of the existing patterns. Let me create all 6 files for the `ai-section` block.

Now let me verify all 6 files were created successfully.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/ai-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files have been created successfully in `template-parts/components/blocks/ai-section/`. Here's a summary of what was built:

**Block structure analysis:**

- **Desktop**: Two-column layout - image (550x600) on left, 4 feature items with blue dots on right, plus a bottom summary text and 3 decorative dividers
- **Mobile**: Stacks to single column - image on top (full width, 400px height), features below. Title drops from 40px/light to 30px/regular. Feature gap reduces from 30px to 25px

**Files created:**

1. **block.html** - Clean semantic HTML preserving the desktop DOM structure: section > container > inner wrapper > header (title + subtitle) + content area (image + features group with repeating feature items, bottom text, and 3 dividers)

2. **block.css** - All Figma styles extracted and scoped to `.ai-section-section`. Uses CSS variables from the design system (`--font-primary`, `--fs-h2`, `--color-primary`, etc.). Responsive breakpoints at 1024px (reduce image), 768px (stack to column matching mobile screenshot), and 480px (tighter spacing)

3. **block.php** - ACF-powered template using `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes()`. Fields: `title`, `subtitle`, `image` (background-image), `content_order` (flip layout toggle), `features` repeater (title + description per item), `bottom_text`. All fields wrapped in `!empty()` checks with proper escaping

4. **block.js** - IIFE pattern with `initAiSection` per-section init, `dataset.jsInitialized` guard, ACF preview hook, MutationObserver for Gutenberg, and full try-catch error handling

5. **block-acf.json** - Complete field definitions with 4 pre-populated feature rows matching the original HTML content, content order select (default/flipped), and proper location targeting `acf/ai-section`

6. **block-config.php** - Block registration with no `enqueue_assets` (theme enqueues Vite bundles), parent/child theme path resolution
