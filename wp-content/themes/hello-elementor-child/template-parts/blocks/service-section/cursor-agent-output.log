Let me first look at the reference screenshots and check the existing project structure.

Now I have a clear picture of the design system and project structure. Let me analyze the desktop vs mobile designs and create all 6 files.
$ mkdir -p /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/service-section (exit 0)

Now let me verify all 6 files exist in the correct directory.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/service-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files have been created successfully. Here's a summary of the **service-section** block:

**Design Analysis (Desktop vs Mobile):**
- **Desktop (1440px):** Two-column layout with a left tab navigation (9 service items) and a right content panel showing the active service's details (title, description, bullet points, CTA button)
- **Mobile (430px):** Tabs are hidden; all service panels are stacked as individual cards with centered descriptions

**Files created in `template-parts/components/blocks/service-section/`:**

1. **block.html** - Static preview with all 9 tabs and 9 content panels (first active, rest hidden via CSS). All content from the desktop Figma export is preserved with semantic class names replacing `figma-*` classes.

2. **block.css** - Comprehensive styles scoped to `.service-section-section`:
   - Desktop: flex row layout, 360px tab column + flex-1 panel column, 65px gap
   - Tablet (<=1024px): reduced gap and tab width
   - Mobile (<=768px): tabs hidden, all panels shown as stacked cards with 30px padding
   - Small mobile (<=480px): tighter padding and smaller typography
   - Uses design system CSS variables (`--color-primary`, `--fs-h2`, `--radius-sm`, etc.)

3. **block.php** - Dynamic ACF template with `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes()`, proper ARIA roles for tabs/panels, `esc_html`/`esc_url`/`wp_kses_post` escaping, and `!empty()` guards on all fields. Loops the `services` repeater twice (tabs + panels).

4. **block.js** - IIFE pattern with tab switching on click, keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home, End), `dataset.jsInitialized`/`jsBound` guards, ACF preview hook, MutationObserver, and comprehensive try-catch error handling.

5. **block-acf.json** - Field definitions with all 9 services pre-populated as default values, nested repeater for bullet points, proper field keys, and block location rule.

6. **block-config.php** - Minimal registration (no `enqueue_assets` per specification), parent/child theme resolve.
