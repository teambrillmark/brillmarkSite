I'll analyze the desktop and mobile HTML, look at the reference screenshots, and create all 6 block files. Let me start by viewing the screenshots and checking the target directory.

Now I have a clear picture of the section structure and the existing block patterns. Let me create all 6 files.

Now let me verify all 6 files were created successfully.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/flexible-modal-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files created. Let me validate the files for consistency.

All 6 files have been created and validated. Here's a summary of the `flexible-modal-section` block:

**Structure:** The section has a title + description header and 3 engagement model cards arranged horizontally (desktop) or stacked vertically (mobile). Each card contains an icon, title, description, a checklist of 4 features with check icons, and a "Learn more" CTA button.

**Files created in `template-parts/components/blocks/flexible-modal-section/`:**

1. **block-config.php** - ACF block registration with parent/child theme path resolution, no `enqueue_assets` (theme handles Vite bundles)

2. **block.html** - Clean semantic HTML preview with 3 cards (Retainer-Based Partnerships, Block of Hours, Project-Based Engagements), all figma-* classes renamed, data-figma attributes removed, container wrapper added

3. **block.php** - ACF template using `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes`, a `cards` repeater with nested `features` repeater, shared `check_icon` image field, proper escaping (`esc_html`, `esc_url`, `wp_kses_post`), all fields wrapped in `!empty()` checks

4. **block.css** - Scoped styles under `.flexible-modal-section-section` preserving Figma proportions (60px padding, 30px card gap, 390px card width, #ecf5fa background). Responsive breakpoints: 1024px (2-col wrap), 768px (single column stack with box-shadow per mobile design, 30px font title), 480px (tighter spacing, full-width buttons)

5. **block.js** - IIFE pattern with `initFlexibleModalSection` per-section guard, `dataset.jsInitialized` dedup, ACF preview hook, MutationObserver, full try-catch error handling

6. **block-acf.json** - Field group with `title` (text), `description` (textarea), `check_icon` (image, shared), and `cards` repeater containing `card_icon`, `card_title`, `card_description`, nested `features` repeater, `button_text`, `button_link`. All 3 default card rows populated with content from the Figma HTML.
