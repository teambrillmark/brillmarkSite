Let me start by examining the visual references and existing block patterns for consistency.

Now let me check for the `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes` function.

Good, the directory exists and is empty. I have all the information I need. Let me create the 6 block files now.

Now let me verify all 6 files exist and do a final validation pass.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/our-process-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files have been created. Let me do a quick validation of the CSS for any issues.
Read /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/our-process-section/block.css
I notice a CSS issue with the panel visibility rules. Let me fix that.
Edited /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/our-process-section/block.css
All 6 files are created and validated. Here's a summary of what was generated:

**Directory:** `template-parts/components/blocks/our-process-section/`

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `block-config.php` | ACF block registration (no `enqueue_assets`, theme handles Vite bundles) |
| `block.html` | Clean semantic HTML with 5 tab buttons + 5 content panels, all Figma classes replaced |
| `block.css` | Scoped styles (`.our-process-section-section`), uses design system tokens (`--space-*`, `--fs-*`, `--color-*`), responsive breakpoints at 1024px/768px/480px |
| `block.php` | ACF template with `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes`, repeater loop used twice (tab bar + panels), all fields wrapped in `!empty()` with proper escaping |
| `block.js` | IIFE pattern, tab switching via `data-tab`/`data-panel` attributes, ACF preview hook, MutationObserver, full try-catch error handling |
| `block-acf.json` | Fields: `title` (text), `description` (textarea), `check_icon` (image), `tabs` (repeater with nested `checklist_items` repeater, `cta_text`, `cta_link`), 5 default rows populated |

**Key design decisions:**
- Desktop: 5 tabs in a horizontal row (flex), active tab gets `#0960A8` background with white text/icons, content panel below with image left + text right
- Mobile (≤480px): tabs stack vertically in a single column with horizontal icon+label layout
- Tablet (≤768px): tabs wrap to 2-column grid, content panel stacks vertically
- Check icon is a shared ACF image field (not hardcoded) per the rules
- The CTA button and checklist items are per-tab (inside the repeater) for maximum flexibility
