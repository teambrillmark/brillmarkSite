Let me start by examining the reference screenshots and checking for any existing blocks to reference.

Let me read the existing files and a reference block to understand the patterns.

Let me check the reference block and the design system CSS files for pattern alignment.

I've reviewed all existing files and the visual references. The existing block is solid but needs several improvements:

1. **block-config.php**: Path is wrong (`/template-parts/blocks/` vs `/template-parts/components/blocks/`)
2. **block.css**: Missing mobile-specific styles (hidden tab list, all panels stacked, blue background, hidden nav arrows)
3. Minor refinements across other files

Now let me rewrite the CSS with comprehensive mobile support matching the mobile reference design.

Now let me verify all 6 files exist and are properly created.
$ ls -la "/Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/optimization-tab-section/" (exit 0)
All 6 files have been created successfully. Here's a summary of the changes made:

### Files Updated in `template-parts/components/blocks/optimization-tab-section/`

**1. `block-config.php`** - Fixed the block path from `/template-parts/blocks/` to `/template-parts/components/blocks/` to match the actual file location and the hero-section reference pattern.

**2. `block.css`** - Major overhaul for responsive design:
- Desktop: Preserved all Figma measurements (40px title, 116px tab height, 450x780 images, etc.)
- Uses CSS custom properties from `variables.css` throughout
- **Mobile (<=768px)**: Background changes to `#daeef8` (matching mobile reference), tab navigation hidden, all panels displayed as stacked accordions with expand/collapse via `mobile-open`/`mobile-closed` classes, nav arrows hidden
- **Tablet (<=1024px)**: Tab buttons wrap, panels retain side-by-side layout with reduced padding
- **Small mobile (<=480px)**: Further typography/spacing reductions

**3. `block.html`** - Added `<button class="optimization-tab-section-panel-mobile-title">` inside each tab panel as an accordion trigger, hidden on desktop via CSS, shown on mobile. All 5 tab panels preserved with full old/new comparison content.

**4. `block.php`** - Added the mobile title button within the repeater loop, rendering the tab label as an accordion header with proper `aria-expanded` attribute. Repeater loops twice: first for tab buttons, second for panels.

**5. `block.js`** - Added mobile accordion behavior:
- Clicking mobile title buttons toggles `mobile-open`/`mobile-closed` classes on panels
- Uses `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT` (768px) to prevent accordion behavior on desktop
- Only one accordion panel open at a time on mobile
- Desktop tab switching, keyboard navigation, and nav arrows preserved
- All handlers wrapped in try-catch per the required error handling pattern

**6. `block-acf.json`** - Preserved the complete field structure with 5 default tab rows matching all content from the Figma export.
