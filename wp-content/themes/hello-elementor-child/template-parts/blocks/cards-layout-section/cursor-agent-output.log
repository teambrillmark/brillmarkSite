Let me start by examining the existing block structure and reference files to match the project patterns.

Let me also check for existing block patterns and the `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes` function.

Now I'll create all 6 files. Let me start with `block.html` and `block.php`.

Let me verify all 6 files were created correctly.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/cards-layout-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files are created. Let me do a quick validation pass on the JSON and PHP.
$ python3 -m json.tool /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/cards-layout-section/block-acf.json > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "JSON valid" || echo "JSON invalid" (exit 0)

$ php -l /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/cards-layout-section/block.php 2>&1 (exit 127)

$ php -l /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/cards-layout-section/block-config.php 2>&1 (exit 127)
JSON is valid. PHP is not installed locally but the syntax follows the project patterns correctly. Let me do a final review of all files to make sure nothing was missed.

All 6 files are complete. Here's a summary of what was created in `template-parts/components/blocks/cards-layout-section/`:

**Block structure:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `block-config.php` | Registers the ACF block (no `enqueue_assets` — theme loads Vite bundles) |
| `block.html` | Clean reference HTML for Variant 1 |
| `block.php` | Conditional rendering: `$layout === '1'` renders process cards, `'2'` renders feature cards |
| `block.css` | Shared base styles + variant-scoped rules via `[data-variant="1"]` / `[data-variant="2"]` |
| `block.js` | IIFE with `initCardsLayoutSection()`, ACF preview hook, MutationObserver |
| `block-acf.json` | Layout select + unified field set with `conditional_logic` for variant-specific fields |

**ACF field architecture:**

- **Common (no conditional):** `layout`, `title`, `description`, `cta_button_text`, `cta_button_url`
- **Variant 1 only:** `cards` repeater (badge, title, desc, nested `checklist_items`), `cta_title`, `cta_description`
- **Variant 2 only:** `feature_cards` repeater (icon image, title, desc), `cta_checklist_items` repeater

**Key design decisions:**
- CSS Grid (`repeat(3, 1fr)`) for the card layout — collapses to 2-col on tablet, 1-col on mobile
- All Figma classes and `data-figma` attributes removed; semantic class names used throughout
- Design system variables (`--color-primary`, `--fs-h2`, `--space-5`, etc.) used wherever Figma values match
- Inline SVG checkmarks instead of image dependency
- `data-variant` attribute on the root `<section>` scopes all CSS per variant
- Both the `btn btn-primary btn-sm` design-system button classes and the `section bg-light` utility classes are applied in the PHP template
