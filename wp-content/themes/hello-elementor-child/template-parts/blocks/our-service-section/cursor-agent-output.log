Let me start by examining the visual reference and existing patterns in the project.

Let me check for existing block examples and look at any helper functions used.

There are already existing files. Let me read them to understand the current state and then regenerate all 6 files properly.

Now I have a complete understanding of the project structure. Let me create all 6 files with proper design system integration, removing all `bm-*` classes, and ensuring Figma visual parity.

Now let me verify all 6 files exist and clean up any backup files.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/our-service-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files have been created successfully. Here's a summary of what was built:

**`block.html`** - Clean HTML preserving the exact Figma DOM structure:
- Section root with `.our-service-section-section .section .bg-light`
- Container wrapper with design system classes (`.flex`, `.flex-col`, `.items-center`, etc.)
- Two tab rows (5 tabs + 4 tabs) with ARIA roles and `data-tab-index`
- 3 sample service panels (first active, others hidden) with image + feature list layout
- Decorative left/right images, prev/next navigation arrows
- Shared CTA button below the slider

**`block.css`** - Comprehensive styles scoped to `.our-service-section-section`:
- All Figma visual values preserved (40px gaps, 35px tab height, 20px pill padding, 60px column gap, 50px panel padding, etc.)
- Active/inactive tab states with color transitions
- Decorative images with CSS mask gradients for fade effect
- Positioned nav arrows with hover shadows
- Desktop CTA visible, per-panel CTA hidden (swapped on mobile)
- Responsive: 1024px (stack columns, hide decor), 768px (stack all panels, hide tabs, show per-panel CTAs), 480px (tighter spacing)

**`block.php`** - ACF template with zero `bm-*` classes:
- `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes()` for block wrapper
- Dynamic tabs via `services` repeater loop
- Dynamic panels with nested `features` repeater
- Shared `check_icon` ACF field for feature list icons
- Per-panel CTA text/link updated via `data-cta-text`/`data-cta-link` attributes
- Proper escaping: `esc_html`, `esc_url`, `esc_attr`, `wp_kses_post`

**`block.js`** - IIFE pattern with full error handling:
- Tab click switching with ARIA state management
- Prev/next arrow navigation (wrapping)
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Desktop CTA text dynamically updates on tab change
- `dataset.jsInitialized` and `dataset.jsBound` guards
- ACF editor preview hook + MutationObserver

**`block-acf.json`** - Complete field definitions:
- `section_title`, `check_icon`, decorative images at top level
- `services` repeater with `tab_label`, `service_title`, `service_image`, `cta_text`, `cta_link`, nested `features` repeater
- All 9 services pre-populated with default values matching the Figma content

**`block-config.php`** - Block registration:
- Correct path: `/template-parts/components/blocks/our-service-section`
- Parent/child theme resolution
- No `enqueue_assets` (theme handles Vite bundles)
