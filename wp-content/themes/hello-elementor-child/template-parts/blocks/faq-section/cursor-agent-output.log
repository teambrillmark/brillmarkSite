Let me start by examining the visual references and existing block patterns for context.

Let me check for the `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes` helper and any existing blocks.

Now let me check if there's an existing block example or the `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes` function anywhere.

Now I have full context of the design system and structure. Let me create all 6 block files.

Now let me verify all 6 files were created correctly.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/faq-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files are created. Here's a summary of the FAQ section block:

**Structure:** Preserves the desktop Figma layout -- two-column FAQ with a vertical divider between columns. On mobile (<=768px), columns stack into a single continuous list and the divider is hidden.

**Files created in `template-parts/components/blocks/faq-section/`:**

1. **block.html** -- Clean semantic HTML with all 11 FAQ items split across two columns (6 left, 5 right), plus hidden answer divs for accordion functionality. Uses design system classes (`.section`, `.bg-white`, `.container`, `.text-center`, `.text-primary`, `.text-secondary`).

2. **block.css** -- Fully scoped to `.faq-section-section`. Desktop: two-column flex layout with 40px gap, vertical divider, 768px-wide header. Mobile (768px): single column, divider hidden, title drops to 30px/regular weight. Includes hover states and accordion open/close transitions (icon rotates 45deg).

3. **block.php** -- Uses `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes()` for the root element. A single `faq_items` repeater is split with `array_slice()` into left/right columns. All fields wrapped in `!empty()` checks with `esc_html()` / `wp_kses_post()` escaping. Shared `faq_icon` image field used for all toggle icons.

4. **block.js** -- IIFE pattern with `initFaqSection(section)` + `dataset.jsInitialized` guard. Click handler toggles `.active` on the item and its sibling answer div. Full error handling with try-catch at every level. ACF preview and MutationObserver support included.

5. **block-acf.json** -- Fields: `title` (text), `description` (textarea), `faq_icon` (image/url), `faq_items` (repeater with `question` text + `answer` wysiwyg sub-fields). All 11 FAQ items pre-populated as default values. Location rule targets `acf/faq-section`.

6. **block-config.php** -- Minimal registration with flat path `/template-parts/blocks/faq-section`, parent/child theme resolution, no `enqueue_assets` (theme handles Vite bundles).
