I'll analyze the desktop and mobile HTML, check reference images and existing block patterns, then create all 6 files.

Let me check the design system files and an existing block for reference patterns.

Let me check for existing blocks to follow the pattern.

Now I have a clear picture of the structure and design system. Let me create all 6 block files.

**Desktop vs Mobile diff:**
- Stats row: `flex-direction: row` (desktop) → `column` (mobile)
- Stats gap: 150px → 30px
- Title: 44px → 36px
- Stat numbers: 40px/weight 400 → 48px/weight 500
- One DOM, CSS media queries handle differences

Now let me verify all files were created.
$ ls -la /Users/kshitijkaushik/Desktop/Git/figma-to-wordpress/template-parts/components/blocks/ready-section/ (exit 0)
All 6 files created successfully in `template-parts/components/blocks/ready-section/`. Here's a summary:

**Structure preservation:** The desktop HTML structure is preserved 1:1 — section > container > content wrapper > (text-wrapper + stats row) with 3 stat items, each containing a number + label. All Figma classes renamed to semantic names, `data-figma` attributes removed.

**Desktop/Mobile responsive strategy (one DOM, CSS only):**
- **Desktop (1440px):** Stats in a horizontal row with 150px gap, title at 44px, stat numbers at 40px/weight-400
- **Tablet (≤1024px):** Stats gap reduces to 60px, title to 38px
- **Mobile (≤768px):** Stats stack vertically with 30px gap, title at 36px, stat numbers grow to 48px with weight-500 (matching mobile Figma)
- **Small mobile (≤480px):** Tighter padding, title 32px, stat numbers 42px

**ACF fields:**
- `title` (text) — default: "Ready to Elevate Your Digital Presence?"
- `description` (textarea) — default: the full paragraph
- `stats` (repeater) — 3 default rows with `stat_number` and `stat_label` sub-fields, pre-populated from the HTML

**Key details:**
- `block.php` uses `theme_get_block_wrapper_attributes()` for the root section
- All `get_field()`/`get_sub_field()` calls wrapped in `!empty()` checks with proper escaping
- `block.js` follows the IIFE pattern with init guard, ACF preview hook, and full try-catch error handling
- `block-config.php` uses the flat path with no `enqueue_assets` (Vite bundle handles CSS/JS)
